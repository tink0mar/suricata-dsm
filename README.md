# DSM module for IDS system Suricata

Here you can fing free version of DSM module for Suricata.

This module was created because QRadar does not provide a working DSM module for Suricata for community version 7.3.

In the [link]([url](https://github.com/tink0mar/move-sids-to-qradar)) it is possible to find the partitioning of the rules into QID records.

A dashboard application has been developed for the DSM module, which can be installed directly into the QRadar system. The application can be downloaded from the link.
